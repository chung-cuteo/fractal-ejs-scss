### Steps to start

1. Install the Package Manager [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) on your computer.

2. Execute the `yarn` command in the directory containing package.json.

3. When the installation is done, just `yarn start` to get started.

4. Do a `git init` to add the project's initial commit and start developing the project 🎉

### Watch out

- If your project has coding guidelines, change the configuration file to suit your environment.

- The dist directory are only html verified, so the developer is responsible for checking the generated files.

- Please run `yarn lint` and `yarn test` frequently to ensure the quality of your source code.

- You can't do a Git commit until you have no more problems with `yarn lint`.
